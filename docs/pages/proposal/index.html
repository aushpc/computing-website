        <h3>
          What is your chosen infographic topic and why is this a topic you wish
          to research?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Our chosen infographic topic is how sleep affects a student’s academic
          performance and mental well-being. We are in our first year of VCE and
          sleep is an important aspect of being able to commit to our studies.
          Additionally, sleep and lifestyle further implicate mental health
          outside of school activities. We wish to pursue this topic not only to
          inform ourselves about the importance of our sleep but also to inform
          our classmates through the creation of our website.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Purpose of the infographic website – Persuade, Inform, or Entertain?
          What does it aim to achieve?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Our infographic website is to inform students on how their sleep
          schedule may be negatively or positively affecting their grades and
          behaviours. We hope by informing them about the effect of sleep they
          can rethink their sleep pattern and evaluate if their situation is
          healthy or not.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Intended audience – Describe the type of students this infographic is
          targeted towards and why, eg age group, ethnicity, gender, interests,
          etc
        </h3>
        <p>
          High schools aged between 16-18 (primarily in their VCE years); as
          they are aiming for higher grades but often compromise proper sleep
          and a healthy lifestyle as a result of this, yet still believe they
          can maximise their academic performance.
        </p>

        <h3>
          What information based on primary data are you aiming to collect and
          present on your infographic?
        </h3>
        <p>
          An anonymous survey asking the amount of sleep students get on average
          a night, we will also ask if the student sleeps at the same time each
          night. The survey will also gather data about the time the student
          wakes up to go to school and any out-of-school interest the students
          take part in, whether that be physical activity or other activities.
          At last the survey will gather the students' average grades obtained.
          Depending on the time of the survey release we might ask the student
          about their 2023 semester 2 information as 2024 grade might not have
          been released
        </p>

        <h3>
          What information based on secondary data are you aiming to research
          and present on your website?
        </h3>
        <p>
          We aim to display research conducted by reputable sources with a
          higher sample size to compare to our data. We will also include
          research on how lack of sleep can affect important hormone levels and
          how it can have an effect on the way you think and if it affects your
          capability to think critically and under pressure.
        </p>

        <h3>
          What will you do to ensure the integrity of your primary and secondary
          data (i.e reliable and free from bias)?
        </h3>
        <p>
          By surveying different interest and friend groups we can avoid trends
          within a particular clique and focus on the trend of the school as a
          whole. For example, some groups may have an internal trend of poor
          sleep whereas others might be on top of their sleep, therefore
          surveying the general population is necessary for unskewed data. We
          are also avoiding sticking to a particular area in the school, like
          the library, to avoid generalisations. However, it might not play a
          particularly big role as the trend is measured by individuals, not as
          a whole. Secondary data must also follow this policy, and must be
          sourced from credible sources like ABS, Department of Education, or
          any credible medical sources.
        </p>

        <h3>
          What will you do to ensure the ethical collection, storage and use of
          collected data?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Data that is collected from individuals who conducted our survey will
          remain anonymous and we will ensure not to share it with anyone. Data
          that is collected will also be stored in a private folder with the
          access only granted to the team building the project. The data that is
          collected will only be used for graphing purposes and the website will
          not include personal anecdotes of individuals to protect their
          privacy. Any hard copies of data will be shredded before being
          recycled to prevent private information from being compromised. This
          will be conveyed to individuals when taking the survey via a consent
          form.
