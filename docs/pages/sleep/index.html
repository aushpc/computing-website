        <p>Lack of sleep can affect teen in mamny different ways including:</p>

            <h3>Academically</h3>
            <p>
              Sleep deprivation can impact your cognitive thinking. During
              sleep, your brain cycles through 3 stages of sleep, where
              chemicals and hormones are released which help the body and
              neurons within the brain recover. Sleep deprivation interrupts
              this process, and the brainâ€™s neurons will end up overworking and
              are less capable of optimal performance. As a result, you might be
              excessively sleepy during the day, have a poor attention span, and
              thus a diminished ability to learn and perform in school.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Physically</h3>
            <p>
              Negative impacts of sleep deprivation on the body include damages
              to brain development, metabolism and immune system.Lack of sleep
              in your developing years can hinder your brain growth and can
              plant the seed for further neurological disorders. Sleep
              deprivation can also double your risk of developing dementia. Many
              large epidemiological studies have suggested that partial sleep
              deprivation is associated with an increased risk of obesity and
              diabete. This is a major concern as sleep deprivation also weakens
              the immune system meaning a sleep deprived population would lead
              to an unhealthy and disease prone society in the future.
            </p>

          <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Emotionally</h3>
            <p>
              Your mood can also be affected by a lack of sleep.. Studies have
              shown that adults, teenagers, and children alike show similar
              impacts on their mental health and emotions when they are
              sleep-deprived. Exaggerated anger, depression, and anxiety have
              been seen in those who are sleep-deprived and these emotions can
              lead to confusion, fatigue, and even weakness. Not getting enough
              sleep can hinder our ability to think clearly and often when
              stressful situations arise we are led to panic.

      <h1>What can we do to improve our health</h1>
      <p>
        Many of us might be realising that we in fact have not been sleeping
        enough. IF you do feel this way you are not alone, studies have
        demonstrated that close to 70 percent of teens do not get a healthy
        amount of sleep per night. This is both alarming and concerning;
        however, what should you do to improve your body's health to combat the
        negative effects of sleep? You should start eating healthy as an
        unhealthy diet plus lack of sleep can both lead to being overweight but
        in teenagers especially boys it can lead to an imbalance in hormones. We
        also start to be aware of your emotions and mood as lack of sleep can
        leave you restless. And finally we should aim to get more physical
        exercise as it can help us get our bodies healthy but also leave our
        bodies tired making it easier to sleep.
