          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p>
            We are in our first year of VCE, sleep is a crucial aspect of being
            able to commit to our studies and insufficient sleep has been
            associated with impaired cognitive function that affects attention
            span and decision-making, both of which are essential for academic
            achievement. This site aims to inform you about how your sleep
            patterns could affect parts of your life including academic
            performance and behavior. We hope that by informing you about the
            effects of sleep, you can rethink your sleep pattern and evaluate
            whether your situation is healthy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our website aims to investigate if a lack of sleep is linked to
            drastic effects on academic performance, mental health, and
            well-being. By exploring these connections, our website seeks to
            raise awareness about the importance of prioritizing sleep for
            overall academic performance, and improved mental health, among
            students. Furthermore, our website contains data regarding sleep and
            lifestyle habits at John Monash Science School collected directly by
            our team, as well as secondary statistics regarding sleep across
            Victoria and Australia, and the health drawbacks of staying up late
            on a school night.

        <h1>Academic Performance</h1>

          What are some factors that affect a student's academic performance?

            <h3>Sleep</h3>
            <p>
              Sleep is shown to have a significant effect on both a student's
              ability to learn content and also affects a student's ability to
              recall information during test conditions.
              <br />-Sometimes it's better to sleep than study!-
            </p>

          <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Mental Health</h3>
            <p>
              A student's mental state is also a key factor in their ability to
              perform during exams. It is good to enter test with a clear mind
              and no unnecessary distractions as this might hinder the student's
              ability to perform.
              <br />-Calming down can be the preparation you're missing!-
            </p>

          <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Lifestyle</h3>
            <p>
              A student's lifestyle choices can also affect their ability to
              perform on assessments. Things like physical wellbeing and health
              can hinder a student's ability to sit and perform over longer
              intervals of time.
              <br />-Take care of your body too!-

        we present will motivate students to pick up healthy practices.
