          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p>
            We are in our first year of VCE, sleep is a crucial aspect of being
            able to commit to our studies and insufficient sleep has been
            associated with impaired cognitive function that affects attention
            span and decision-making, both of which are essential for academic
            achievement. This site aims to inform you about how your sleep
            patterns could affect parts of your life including academic
            performance and behavior. We hope that by informing you about the
            effects of sleep, you can rethink your sleep pattern and evaluate
            whether your situation is healthy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our website aims to investigate if a lack of sleep is linked to
            drastic effects on academic performance, mental health, and
            well-being. By exploring these connections, our website seeks to
            raise awareness about the importance of prioritizing sleep for
            overall academic performance, and improved mental health, among
            students. Furthermore, our website contains data regarding sleep and
            lifestyle habits at John Monash Science School collected directly by
            our team, as well as secondary statistics regarding sleep across
            Victoria and Australia, and the health drawbacks of staying up late
            on a school night.

              ability to learn content and also affects a students ability to

            <h3>Mental Health</h3>
            <p>
              A student's mental state is also a key factor in their ability to
              perform during exams. It is good to enter test with a clear mind
              and no uneccasary distractions as this might hinder the students
              ability to perform.
              <br />-Calming down can be the preparation your missing!-
