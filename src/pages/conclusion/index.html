        <h1>What we found</h1>
        <p>
          A majority of respondents reported sleeping between 7 and 9 hours
          every night. However, many students reported inconsistent sleep
          schedules (i.e. not sleeping at the same time every night.).#
          <br />
          Restorative sleep requires consistent schedules and early sleep times.
          Increased sleep quality is directly linked with improved emotional
          regulation and more performant cognition. Some respondents indicated
          they were sometimes not focused or tired in class, probably related to
          poor sleep habits.
        </p>

        <p>
          Daily routines, including screen time before bed, physical activity,
          and consumption of energy drinks, show a correlation with sleep
          patterns. Students engaging in regular physical activity and limiting
          screen time before bed reported better sleep quality and alertness.
        </p>

        <p>
          Students with consistent sleep schedules and higher sleep quality more
          often report higher average grades. This suggests that good sleep
          management is a major factor in academic success.
        </p>

        <p>
          Students who reported feeling tired in class or having difficulty
          focusing also often reported inconsistent or insufficient sleep. Mood
          ratings correlate with sleep quality, indicating that better sleep is
          associated with a more positive mood on average.
        </p>

        <p>
          In conclusion, the survey data highlights the importance of consistent
          sleep for maintaining mental health and achieving academic success. It
          suggests that interventions aimed at improving sleep, such as
          establishing consistent sleep schedules, reducing screen time before
          bed, engaging in regular physical activity, and limiting the intake of
          energy drinks and caffiene, have benefits for student wellbeing and
          performance. Educators should consider these findings when designing
          policies to support student health and learning outcomes.
