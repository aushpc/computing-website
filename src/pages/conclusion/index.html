      A majority of respondents reported sleeping between 7 and 9 hours every
      night. However, many students reported inconsistent sleep schedules (i.e.
      not sleeping at the same time every night.).#
      <br />
      Restorative sleep requires consistent schedules and early sleep times.
      Increased sleep quality is directly linked with improved emotional
      regulation and more performant cognition. Some respondents indicated they
      were sometimes not focused or tired in class, probably related to poor sleep
      habits.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Daily routines, including screen time before bed, physical activity, and
      consumption of energy drinks, show a correlation with sleep patterns.
      Students engaging in regular physical activity and limiting screen time
      before bed reported better sleep quality and alertness.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Students with consistent sleep schedules and higher sleep quality more often
      report higher average grades. This suggests that good sleep management is a
      major factor in academic success.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Students who reported feeling tired in class or having difficulty focusing
      also often reported inconsistent or insufficient sleep. Mood ratings
      correlate with sleep quality, indicating that better sleep is associated
      with a more positive mood on average.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      In conclusion, the survey data highlights the importance of consistent sleep
      for maintaining mental health and achieving academic success. It suggests
      that interventions aimed at improving sleep, such as establishing consistent
      sleep schedules, reducing screen time before bed, engaging in regular
      physical activity, and limiting the intake of energy drinks and caffiene,
      have benefits for student wellbeing and performance. Educators should
      consider these findings when designing policies to support student health
      and learning outcomes.
