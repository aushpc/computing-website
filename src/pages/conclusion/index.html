        A majority of respondents reported sleeping between 7 and 9 hours every
        night. However, many students reported inconsistent sleep schedules
        (i.e. not sleeping at the same time every night.).#
        <br />
        Restorative sleep requires consistent schedules and early sleep times.
        Increased sleep quality is directly linked with improved emotional
        regulation and more performant cognition. Some respondents indicated
        they were sometimes not focused or tired in class, probably related to
        poor sleep habits.
      </p>

      <p>
        Daily routines, including screen time before bed, physical activity, and
        consumption of energy drinks, show a correlation with sleep patterns.
        Students engaging in regular physical activity and limiting screen time
        before bed reported better sleep quality and alertness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Students with consistent sleep schedules and higher sleep quality more
        often report higher average grades. This suggests that good sleep
        management is a major factor in academic success.
      </p>

      <p>
        Students who reported feeling tired in class or having difficulty
        focusing also often reported inconsistent or insufficient sleep. Mood
        ratings correlate with sleep quality, indicating that better sleep is
        associated with a more positive mood on average.
      </p>

      <p>
        In conclusion, the survey data highlights the importance of consistent
        sleep for maintaining mental health and achieving academic success. It
        suggests that interventions aimed at improving sleep, such as
        establishing consistent sleep schedules, reducing screen time before
        bed, engaging in regular physical activity, and limiting the intake of
        energy drinks and caffiene, have benefits for student wellbeing and
        performance. Educators should consider these findings when designing
        policies to support student health and learning outcomes.
