    <h3>Sport and academic performance</h3>
    <p>
      We compared extracurricular activites to academic grade performance
      average of participants in that activity
    </p>
    <div style="width: 80%">
      <canvas id="extraGradeChart"></canvas>
    </div>
    <p>
      Overall, people who engaged in performing arts, non-ball sports, and no
      hobbies had the highest grade averages respectively (excluding
      non-miscellaneous hobbies), with the average grade ranges from 81.67%,
      81.67%, and then 77.5%. Although the difference can be neglible and minor
      especially with a smaller sample size, there is still some evidence that
      extracurricular activities can boost academic performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the United States Department of Education,
      <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1208711.pdf" target="_blank"
        >students engaging in extracurricular activities had higher test scores
        compared to their peers. </a
      >It is important to note that there was neglible grade difference between
      those who engaged in zero, and only one extracurricular activity, which
      might have been demonstrated by our survey. For males, athletic
      participation was associated with a higher grade point average; and sport
      team participation was associated with a higher grade point average for
      females.
    </p>
    <p>
      The study also associated extracurricular activities with a more positive
      mood and attraction to school than non-participants, which was somewhat
      supported by our survey results.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grade field worked in ranges and therefore does not produce any more
      of a precise answer, furthermore we did not survey study habits.

    <h3>Does a good lifestyle actually help?</h3>
    <p>We drew connections between sleep and mental health..</p>
    <p>
      The Australian Institute of Family Studies recommends
      <a
        href="https://aifs.gov.au/media/australian-teens-not-getting-enough-sleep#:~:text=Institute%20Research%20Fellow%2C%20Dr%20Tracy,and%2010%20hours%20of%20sleep."
        target="_blank"
        >8-10 hours of sleep</a
      >
      for teenagers every night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most respondents do not get enough sleep, on an average of
      <b>6.87 hours</b> and past 10pm about <b>5</b> times per week, which is
      well below the healthy amount of sleep of <b>8-10 hours</b>. Furthermore,
      the average mood reported was <b>6.6</b> on the 1-10 scale. While not
      extremely low, it indicates room for improvement in the surveyed
      population and a possible correlation between sleep and mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The majority of respondents <b>(51.28%)</b> indicated their grades in the
      71%-80% range, and <b>30.77%</b> in the 80-90% range.
      <br />
      The distribution shows high academic performance, however may be skewed as
      respondents attend a selective school, and were traditionally high
      performing students.
    </p>
    <p>
      For those who met the 8 hour minimum recommendation, the grade average was
      <b>86%</b>. The average for those who did not meet the recommendation (29
      respondents) had an average grade of <b>82%</b>.
