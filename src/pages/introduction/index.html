    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      We are in our first year of VCE, sleep is a crucial aspect of being able
      to commit to our studies and insufficient sleep has been associated with
      impaired cognitive function that affects attention span and
      decision-making, both of which are essential for academic achievement.
      This site aims to inform you about how your sleep patterns could affect
      parts of your life including academic performance and behavior. We hope
      that by informing you about the effects of sleep, you can rethink your
      sleep pattern and evaluate whether your situation is healthy.

      Our website aims to investigate if a lack of sleep is linked to drastic
      effects on academic performance, mental health, and well-being. By
      exploring these connections, our website seeks to raise awareness about
      the importance of prioritizing sleep for overall academic performance, and
      improved mental health, among students. Furthermore, our website contains
      data regarding sleep and lifestyle habits at John Monash Science School
      collected directly by our team, as well as secondary statistics regarding
      sleep across Victoria and Australia, and the health drawbacks of staying
      up late on a school night.
