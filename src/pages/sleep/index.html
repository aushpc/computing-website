      <p>Lack of sleep can affect teen in mamny different ways including:</p>

          <h3>Accademically</h3>
          <p>
            Sleep deprivation can also impact your cognitive thinking. During
            sleep, your brain cycles through 3 stages of sleep, where chemicals
            and hormones are released which help the body and neurons within the
            brain recover. Sleep deprivation interrupts this process, and the
            brainâ€™s neurons will end up overworking and are less capable of
            optimal performance. As a result, you might be excessively sleepy
            during the day, have a poor attention span, and thus a diminished
            ability to learn and perform in school.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="course-col">
          <h3>Physically</h3>
          <p>
            Negative impacts of sleep deprivation on the body include damages to
            brain development, metabolism and immune system.Lack of sleep in
            your developing years can hinder your brain growth and can plant the
            seed for further neurological disorders. Sleep deprivation can also
            double your risk of developing dementia. Many large epidemiological
            studies have suggested that partial sleep deprivation is associated
            with an increased risk of obesity and diabete. This is a major
            concern as sleep deprivation also weakens the immune system meaning
            a sleep deprived population would lead to an unhealthy and disease
            prone society in the future.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="course-col">
          <h3>Emotionally</h3>
          <p>
            Sleep deprivation can also affect your mood. Studies have shown that
            adults, teenagers, and children alike show similar impacts on their
            mental health and emotions when they are sleep-deprived. Exaggerated
            anger, depression, and anxiety have been seen in those who are
            sleep-deprived and these emotions can lead to confusion, fatigue,
            and even weak. Sleep disorders like insomnia are more likely to lead
            to mental health and mood disorders
