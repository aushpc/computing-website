          <h1>Effects of Sleep Deprivation on Mental Health</h1>
          <p>
            Sleep isn’t just a period of rest in our lives. It’s the body’s way
            of recovering and getting ready for the next day's challenges. It’s
            a vital function of how our bodies work and missing even just a
            couple of hours of sleep can deteriorate the quality of the rest of
            the day. Sleep deprivation doesn’t just lead to feeling tired and
            drowsy. Over time, getting less sleep can cascade into a list of
            symptoms and put you in a dangerous and vicious cycle One of the
            most documented effects of sleep deprivation is its influence on our
            mood. Multiple studies over the last few decades have consistently
            shown a link between insufficient sleep and increased anxiety and
            irritability. Without enough sleep, our emotional regulation is
            hindered and can make us feel on the edge and stressed. Everyday
            situations that might not normally bother us can suddenly feel like
            the world is ending. This emotional vulnerability can also
            accumulate as mood swings, making it difficult to maintain healthy
            relationships and navigate social interactions.<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Sleep deprivation's grip extends to our cognitive abilities as well.
            When sleep-deprived, our brains struggle to focus, concentrate, and
            retain information. This can lead to difficulties with memory,
            making it hard to remember details or learn new things. This can
            heavily impact the learning ability of. Decision-making becomes
            clouded, and our ability to solve problems efficiently suffers.
            Imagine trying to complete a complex task at work or study for an
            exam while running on fumes – that's the reality for someone
            chronically sleep-deprived.<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            The impact on mental health goes even deeper. Research suggests that
            sleep deprivation can worsen symptoms of existing mental health
            conditions like depression and bipolar disorder. Furthermore,
            chronic sleep problems are a risk factor for developing these
            conditions in the first place. It becomes a vicious cycle: mental
            health struggles disrupt sleep patterns, and poor sleep exacerbates
            mental health symptoms.<br />

      <h1>How to Improve our Mental State</h1>
      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        As recommended by Mind, a UK based health health service, one of the
        most important things to do to improve your mental well being is to
        improve your sleep. However, other things we can do to help our mental
        state include finding a hobby outside of school that helps us take our
        mind away from school. During our surveying we discovered many subnets
        have hobbies outside of school, however we all know of some that do not
        have a hobby out of school. It is encouraging if you are a student
        without an out of school hobby that you do find something that you
        enjoy. This doesn't have to be physically demanding, it can be knitting
        or painting but it also can be a physically intense hobby like going to
        the gym. Either way Having a hobby that takes your mind away from school
        can be a way to remove the looming stress of pending assessments and can
        help our minds calm down. This gives students the ability to think
        clearly and study more effectively. It is also known that many students
        drop hobbies during their final years of schooling many health
        organisations disapprove of this and so do we as in your last few years
        are our most stressful. As dropping hobbies at this time will leave us
        stressed out, overworked and feeling empty as school becomes our only
        goal.
      </p>
      <h2>Spend Time With Others</h2>
      <p>
        Especially in today's times with the use of technology to connect to
        others, some of us might feel disconnected and lonely. Although
        technology allows us to contact our friends whenever we want, it is also
        important to know that physical interaction is essential to a person's
        wellbeing. A caution the WebMD refers to as “Touch Starvation” is where
        a person goes a long time with minimal physical contact or no physical
        contact at all. This can be caused by proximity restrictions like
        COVID-19 but also can be caused by the person's unwillingness to leave
        their home. For students that spend their entire time studying this can
        mean that they also experience a form of touch starvation.This is
        important as the skin communicates both positive and negative touch
        sensations to the brain. Your brain releases the hormone oxytocin when
        you engage in pleasant touch, such as an embrace. This reduces anxiety
        and fear and strengthens social and emotional ties. When we spend too
        much time alone we can become stressed, anxious, or depressed. As a
        response to stress, your body makes a hormone called cortisol. This can
        cause your heart rate, blood pressure, muscle tension, and breathing
        rate to go up, with bad effects for your immune and digestive systems.
        These releases of hormones can also make it harder for our bodies to
        fall asleep leading students into restless nights. Because of this it is
        essential students get outside and interact with their family or peers
        in their free time.
      </p>
      <h2>Journaling</h2>
      <p>
        For the times we cant be around others we can also practise other
        mindfulness techniques. One technique used by many people is journaling.
        Journaling can help us recount the events of the day, doing this at the
        end of a school day can help you remember the things you learnt in class
        and recording them in a book can help us create mini notes for when we
        revise. Journaling can also be a way to help us recognize our emotions
        when we feel overwhelmed, as students it is not unusual to feel
        overwhelmed with assessments and feelings. When we journal we can keep a
        record for tasks we have yet to finish. This can help us not forget
        assessment and prevents us from leaving things until the last minute.
        Writing everyday can also prompt you to keep a routine, which can help
        students in the future as a structured routine can help with a less
        stressful and less chaotic day. Studies have shown that journaling can
        reduce your anxiety. Researchers found that those with various medical
        conditions and anxiety who wrote online for 15 minutes three days a week
        over a 12-week period had increased feelings of well-being and fewer
        depressive symptoms after one month. Their mental well-being continued
        to improve during the 12 weeks of journaling. Even if a student does not
        suffer from a mental illness they still experience emotions such as
        anxiety which can be greatly helped with journaling. It also creates a
        sense of awareness in a situation we might be going through and can help
        students focus on school and what makes them happy, rather than the
        negative thing going on in their life. Overall, journalling is a great
        way for students to wind down, become aware and control their emotions.
